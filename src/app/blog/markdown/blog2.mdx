# Common Mistakes in Writing Acceptance Criteria

<div style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>{props.date.toString()}</div>

Writing acceptance criteria might seem straightforward, but it’s easy to get it wrong. These criteria are essential for ensuring that a feature meets the needs of users and the team’s expectations. However, poorly written acceptance criteria can lead to confusion, missed deadlines, and a whole lot of frustration. Let’s dive into some of the most common mistakes and how to avoid them.

## 1. **Being Too Vague**

Acceptance criteria should be clear and specific. If they’re too broad or ambiguous, different team members might interpret them differently, leading to inconsistent results. Avoid phrases like "should work smoothly" and focus on concrete, measurable conditions like "form should submit successfully when all fields are filled out."

## 2. **Overloading with Details**

While clarity is key, overloading your acceptance criteria with excessive details can be counterproductive. Long lists of conditions can make criteria hard to understand and even harder to follow. Stick to the most important points and avoid getting lost in the weeds.

## 3. **Skipping Edge Cases**

It’s easy to focus only on the “happy path,” but real users often don’t behave as expected. Failing to account for edge cases can lead to critical issues slipping through. Think about how the system should handle unexpected inputs or actions, and include these scenarios in your criteria.

## 4. **Not Aligning with User Needs**

Your acceptance criteria should be driven by the user’s needs, not just technical requirements. If the criteria don’t align with the user story’s goals, the feature might meet technical standards but fail to deliver value to the user.

## 5. **Ignoring Collaboration**

Acceptance criteria shouldn’t be written in isolation. When only one person creates the criteria without input from developers, testers, or other stakeholders, key details can be overlooked. Involve the team in defining criteria to ensure everyone is on the same page.

## Conclusion

Avoiding these common mistakes can make your acceptance criteria more effective, leading to clearer communication, better alignment, and ultimately, a smoother development process. Keep it simple, specific, and always user-focused—your team (and users) will thank you.
